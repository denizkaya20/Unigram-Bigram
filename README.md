# Unigram-Bigram
Unigram and Bigram Language Model Calculation
Overview
This project calculates unigram and bigram probabilities from a given set of sentences. Additionally, Add-k smoothing is applied to adjust the probabilities, and the likelihood of a new sentence is calculated based on these smoothed probabilities.
