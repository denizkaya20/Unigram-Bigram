# Unigram-Bigram
This programme finds the number of unigrams and bigrams in the following sample text and gives the probability values of all unigrams and bigrams. 
It calculates all smoothed bigram probability values using the add-k smoothing method (taking k as 0.5). 

<s> Sen dün eve geldin </s>
<s> Sen eve gittin </s>
<s> eve sen gittin </s>
<s> Eve geldin </s>

Calculates the probability value of the following sentence using the smoothed bigram values obtained:

<s> Eve dün sen geldin </s>
